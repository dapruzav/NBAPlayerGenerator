# NBAPlayerGenerator
A web scraping program created with Selenium in Python that allows the user to generate up to date NBA players with a couple inputs.

Features I would like to add:
  - Randomly generate players by college (ex. Duke) from user input
  - Randomly generate players by position (ex. G, F, C) from user input
  - Randomly generate players by team (ex. Heat, Hawks) from user input

Steps to Use:
  1. Install Python via the Python download site (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. In terminal, type the command "pip install -U selenium" to download Selenium to your computer
  3. Add the selenium package to your project

Here is a very helpful video to get started in PyCharm (you don't need to download a driver):
