# NBAPlayerGenerator
A web scraping program created with Selenium in Python that allows the user to generate up to date NBA players with a couple inputs.

Features I would like to add:
  - Randomly generate players by college (ex. Duke) from user input
  - Randomly generate players by position (G, F, C) from user input
